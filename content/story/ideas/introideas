### Thinking of these on the spot and didint want to forget them ###

---

#### Intro
+ Something to do with being dismantled/deconstructed in a room similar to a garbage incinerator <br><small>something like the necromancers room in castle crushers</small>
+ Start off with very limited movement, walking through a vast trashzone <br> <small>(Pipes with falling trash you need to avoid, if you move too slow they create an obstacle or the map eventually becomes to difficult to navigate)</small> <br>something similar to mother 3 porkys underground highways.
+ Some scene happens or discovering a part of your body/ability that enhances the movement of your character
    
    > Potentially:<br><br>
    Missing different components of your body? Start as a head and have to slowly roll, then you find your torso quickly - which allows you to dash.<br><br>
    Then legs which allow you to jump and walk<br><br>
    Then Arms maybe incorporating a wallrun / walljump mechanic?


#### Character aesthetics?
lowpoly, PS1 render esque, something similar to syril psudeoregalia / V1 Ultrakill
